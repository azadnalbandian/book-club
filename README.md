## Introduction

This is a tiny command-line utility for picking a random book to read from the user's Goodreads owned books. It was initially built for my wife to use. Right now, it doesn't do much, though I am planning to build it out further later with more utilities (depending on what I can think of).

## Usage

This version doesn't have the API key or secret included, so it's not usable. They're pulled from the App.config file.
